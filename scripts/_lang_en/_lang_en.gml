	 Everything that comes after "//" is a comment and should not be translated
	 Only texts within "quotes" should be translated, except for names like "Gustavo Barros", "Dani Serranú", etc.
	
	With the intention of facilitating the translation of the poem, here are some observations.
	
	"comfort and sweetness of peace" is a concise piece of literature that serves as a metaphor for the cycles of life and death:
	
	"after the clouds, the sunshine",
	"after the winter, the spring",
	"after the shower, the rainbow",
	"for life is a changeable thing",
	"after the night, the morning",
	"bidding all darkness cease",
	"after life's cares and sorrows",
	"the comfort and sweetness of peace",
	
	
	Just as the clouds give way to sunshine, and the winter blossoms into spring, our own lives also experience ups and downs.
	Moonleap is a game that embodies these same themes, the poem is by far the most significant text in the entire game.
	
	When translating this poem, consider: meter and rhyme
	We have a set structure to work with: A, B, C, B, B, D, C, D.
	ine, ing, ow, ing, ing, ease, ows, eace
	
	This affords you some freedom in terms of adhering to a strict meter, but it's still worthwhile to try to maintain some consistency with the original
	While a direct translation may capture the meaning of the words, it can lose the beauty and musicality of the original
	
	Carefully choose words and phrasing that capture the feeling and tone of the poem, while also making sure the translated words fit into the structure
	Translating a poem is a delicate balance of preserving the original and creating something new and beautiful in the target language
	- Guselect and Miguel Mendes
